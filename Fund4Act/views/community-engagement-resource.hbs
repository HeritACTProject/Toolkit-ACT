    <pre>
        These guidelines provide a structured approach for implementing community engagement heritage actions, ensuring that projects are inclusive, meaningful, and contribute to a sense of shared responsibility and pride within the community. Adjustments can be made based on the specific context and goals of the community engagement initiatives.

        1. Project Planning and Coordination:
        Define Objectives: Clearly outline the goals of community engagement, emphasising shared responsibility, and fostering pride in heritage projects.

        Project Coordination Team: Form a team with expertise in community engagement, project management, and heritage preservation to ensure effective coordination.

        2. Project Scope and Community Involvement:
        Select Meaningful Projects: Choose projects that resonate with the community and align with the broader heritage goals. Ensure diverse representation in project selection.

        Community Partnerships: Establish partnerships with local organisations, schools, and community groups to broaden community involvement in heritage initiatives.

        3. Legal Considerations:
        Permitting and Permissions: Obtain necessary permits for community-led projects. Ensure compliance with local regulations and heritage preservation laws.

        Communication with Authorities: Keep open lines of communication with local authorities to gain support and address any concerns related to community-led initiatives.

        4. Communication and Outreach:
        Inclusive Communication: Use inclusive language and diverse communication channels to reach all segments of the community. Encourage open dialogue and feedback.

        Promotion of Heritage Values: Highlight the cultural and historical significance of the projects to instil a sense of pride and ownership among community members.

        5. Logistics and Infrastructure:
        Resource Allocation: Allocate resources effectively for community-led projects. Provide necessary tools, materials, and logistical support for successful implementation.

        Participant Engagement: Encourage active participation by providing a supportive and inclusive environment. Ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued.

        6. Skills Development and Training:
        Workshop Facilitation: Train project leaders and facilitators in effective community engagement and heritage preservation techniques. Empower community members to take active roles.

        Skill Enhancement: Offer workshops that enhance skills relevant to the heritage projects, fostering a sense of accomplishment and community pride.

        7. Cultural Programming:
        Cultural Inclusion: Integrate cultural elements into the projects. Ensure that heritage initiatives respect and celebrate the diverse cultural backgrounds within the community.

        Interactive Heritage Workshops: Organise workshops that allow for interactive learning about the community's heritage. Encourage storytelling and the sharing of personal experiences.

        8. Financial Management:
        Transparent Budgeting: Clearly outline the budget for community-led projects. Communicate how funds will be used to benefit the community and preserve heritage.

        9. Post-Project Evaluation:
        Impact Assessment: Evaluate the impact of community-led projects on heritage preservation and community engagement. Document successes and areas for improvement.

        Community Feedback: Collect feedback from participants and the broader community. Use insights to refine future community engagement initiatives.

        10. Public Relations and Recognition:
