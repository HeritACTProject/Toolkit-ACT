    <h1>Sharing Relevant Links: A Quick Guide for Fund4Action Action Creators</h1>
    <pre>Strengthen your credibility and increase support by including relevant links that showcase your group’s work, values and community impact. Here’s a quick guide on what to share:

1. Link to an Impact Report
Have you published an annual report or community impact summary?
📄 Include it. This gives potential pledgers insight into your transparency, track record, and commitment to making a difference.

2. Share Videos of Past Actions
📹 A YouTube or Vimeo link to a short video showing a previous event, clean-up day, planting session, or community gathering brings your action to life.
Visual storytelling builds trust and excitement.

3. Add Social Media Handles
Include links to your active social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).
🌍 These show how you communicate, engage, and grow your local community.

4. Website or Blog
If your group has a website, include it.
🖥️ A simple site or blog with project updates, community stories, or upcoming events helps pledgers learn more about your mission and ethos.

5. Press Articles or Mentions
If your work has been covered in local news, a community newsletter, or radio show, link to it!
📰 This adds credibility and demonstrates public recognition of your efforts.

6. Testimonials or Case Studies
Include any online stories, quotes, or short case studies that reflect community support or the success of previous actions.
💬 These make your work feel relatable and authentic.</pre>
